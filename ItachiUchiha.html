                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p> From the popular anime series "Naruto Shippuden" comes a Nendoroid of Itachi Uchiha from his time in the Anbu Black Ops! He comes with two interchangeable face platesâ€”a standard face plate and a Sharingan face plate.

                        Optional parts include his sword, a kunai and his Anbu Black Ops mask. An interchangeable lower body part and a utility pole part are also included, allowing you to recreate a famous scene from the series.
